# RecipeCrawler
Crawls the internet for recipes catered to your ingredients. 
This proposed project is a web application, that takes the suggestions from the user on ingredients available and 
crawls the internet to search the relevant recipes that the end user can make use of. 

Also this application should do machine learning in the side, and rank the websites that user visits more frequently. And based
on this rank, the search results should be displayed accordingly.
